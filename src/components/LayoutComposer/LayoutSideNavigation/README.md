# LayoutSideNavigation

This component creates a layout with sidebar on the left hand side containing some navigational
tabs. On small screens, this is collapsed into a single column layout:

- topbar
- sideNav
- main
- footer

Note: this responsive behaviour is not (yet) created with responsiveAreas, since those don't support
server-side rendering.
